# PILHELP
Here you'll see the code and the result of running this code. 

Obviously, you'll need to tweek the code.

For example, you need to change the source of the image.
Also, you'll probably want to change the width of the white area that the text will be in. From your sketch it seemed like you wanted the text portion to be smaller.

Good luck!
